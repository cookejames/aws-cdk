######################################
Performing Common Tasks With the |cdk|
######################################

This topic describes how to perform some common tasks with the |cdk|.
Each section starts with the question "How do I" and supplies an answer.
Note that there are often multiple ways of performing a task.
This topic describes the simplest, most straightforward way.

.. _how_to_use_cfn_template:

How do I use an Existing |CFN| Template?
========================================

The |cdk| provides a mechanism that you can use in your code to include an
existing |CFN| template in your app.

The following example includes the template *my-template.json* into the
existing app and gets the ARN of the bucket **mybucket** from the
template.

First make sure you have the |S3|, |IAM|, and ??? packages installed.

.. code-block:: js

    npm i -g 

.. code-block:: js

    import cdk = require('@aws-cdk/cdk');
    import fs = require('fs');

    const myTemplate = fs.readFileSync('my-template.json').toString();

    new cdk.Include(this, 'ExistingInfra', {
        template: JSON.parse(myTemplate)
    });
    
    // To get the bucket's ARN:
    const bucketArn = new cdk.FnGetAtt('mybucket', 'Arn');

The *my-template.json' must have the following resource,
where **abcdwxyz** is the unique, 8-character hash that the |cdk| generates for the resource:

.. code-block:: json

   "TheBucketabcdwxyz": {
      "Type": "AWS::S3::Bucket",
      "Properties": {
         "BucketName": "mybucket"
      }
   }

.. _how_to_add_a_stack:

How do I Add a Stack to My App?
===============================

To add a stack to your app,
create a new class that extends the
::py:class:`_aws-cdk_core.Stack` class,
as shown in the following example.

.. code-block:: js

   import { Stack, StackProps } from '@aws-cdk/core';
   // ...
   class HelloStack extends Stack {
      constructor(parent: App, name: string, props?: StackProps) {
         super(parent, name, props);
      }
   }

.. _how_to_create_stack_in_region:

How do I Create a Stack in a Specific Region?
=============================================

To create a stack in **us-west-2** in your app,
and set the **region** property of the **env**
member of the **StackProps** argument to your stack when creating it,
as shown in the following example.

.. code-block:: js

   new HelloStack(this, 'hello-cdk-us-west-2', {
      env: {
         region: 'us-west-2'
   }});

.. _how_to_azs:

How do I Get the Availability Zones in a Region?
================================================

You can get the AZs in the current region by using the
::py:class:`_aws-cdk_core.AvailabilityZoneProvider` class,
as shown in the following example.

.. code-block:: js

   const zones: string[] = new AvailabilityZoneProvider(this).availabilityZones;

   for (let zone of zones) {
      // do somethning for each zone!
   }

.. _how_to_opt_out:

How do I Opt Out of Usage Tracking?
===================================

// What was the innocuous name we gave this?

.. _how_to_write_secrets:

How do I Store my Secret Data?
==============================

Info on storing/retrieving secret data?

.. code-block:: sh

   cdk write-secret STACK Username=NAME Password=PASSWORD

.. _how_to_use_cfn_template_different_region:

How do I use an Existing |CFN| Template in a Different Region?
==============================================================

Is this even possible? Planned?

.. _how_to_create_nested_stack:

How do I Create a Nested Stack?
===============================

If we create a section in another topic,
should this just be a link to that section?

.. _how_to_see_my_metrics:

How do I See my Metrics?
========================

If we gather data, do we think users will want to see it?

.. _how_to_tag_resources:

How do I Tag my Resources?
==========================

and use that info

.. _how_to_add_runtime:

How do I Access Deploy Time Values?
===================================

SSM? Environent variables? cdk.json?

.. _how_to_integrate_with_my_ide:

How do I Use the |cdk| in My IDE?
=================================

Which IDEs should be support with setup instructions?
Paul's already got Cloud9 going,
what about VS Code, Eclipse, NetBeans, Visual Studio?

.. _how_to_cross_accounts:

How do I Work Across Accounts?
==============================

Question from a user:

How can I trigger a Lambda function running in a VPC in Account A
from an SNS topic in Account B?

.. _how_to_cross_regions:

How do I Work Across Regions?
=============================

Related: How to ensure service is available in a region.

.. _how_to_debug:

How do I Debug my |cdk| App?
============================

Tools & Techniques, logging, ???

.. _how_to_estimate_costs:

How do I Estimate my Stack's Cost?
==================================

Or is this a CFN issue?

.. _how_to_share_resources:

How do I Share Resources Between Stack?
=======================================

Or other constructs?

.. _how_to_create_large_apps:

How do I Create a Large-Scale APP?
==================================

// Probably not just a how-to, but a section in a topic or an entire topic?

.. _how_to_overcome_200_limit:

How do I Overcome the |CFN| 200 Resource Limit?
===============================================

Related to sub-stacks?

.. _how_to_request_service_l2:

How do I Request an |l2| Construct?
===================================

Since we won't have 100% coverage at GA,
what's the recommended way for users to ask for a missing |l2| construct?
GitHub PR/Issue?

.. _how_to_link_lambda_code:

How do I Link the Code for a Lambda Function to an AWS Lambda Resource?
=======================================================================

Inquiring minds want to know.

.. _how_to_transition:

How do I Port My |CFN| Template to the |cdk|?
=============================================

We should map out a couple of scenarios:

- Leave existing templates alone and add new functionality using the |cdk|.

- Refactor existing templates into opinionated constructs where possible.

- ???

.. _how_to_modify_l2:

How do I Modify an |l2| Construct?

For example, before we supported AES256 in S3,
how would the user get that functionality?
Fork our S3 |l2| construct and make a change?

How do I Create a |l3| Library?
===============================

We used to have Goldberg as a proof of concept.
Do we have a replacement?

I don't see |l3| in the glossary.
Is that by design?
